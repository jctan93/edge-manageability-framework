# Design Proposal: Decouple MicroOS storage from the orchestrator

## Abstract

[A short summary of the proposal with an introduction and the problem being
solved by the proposed change. Include useful persona flows.]

Currently, the MicroOS (HookOS) image is stored on the Kubernetes PV and exposed via the Provisioning Nginx server
for Edge Nodes to download the image via iPXE during EN provisioning. This poses the following issues:

- There is a strong coupling between control plane (the Edge Orchestrator) and storage layer. We should isolate them.
- In a remote, distributed environment the Edge Orchestrator may be far from Edge Nodes, causing high delays and possibly low bandwidth.
  Moreover, the access to PV is rate-limited and may be slow (it can have even bigger impact when onboarding multiple nodes in parallel).
  All of these impacts the provisioning time significantly and we already know that the MicroOS download step takes the biggest portion of time during provisioning.

This proposal aims at solving the above issues by decoupling the MicroOS storage from the orchestrator, i.e. removing a dependency on PV for MicroOS.
This should significantly improve the EN provisioning time.

## Proposal

> **NOTE:** This proposal assumes that HookOS is replaced with a minimal Edge Microvisor Toolkit flavor that is used as a Micro-OS for provisioning.

### Challenge

At a high-level, this design proposal moves the MicroOS image storage from the orchestrator to an external storage, such as Release File Server (e.g., S3 bucket)
or a local storage (e.g., a local, on-prem file server). The orchestrator will no longer be responsible for storing the MicroOS image.
Instead, it will only provide a URL to the image stored in an external storage.

Currently, the HookOS image is curated by DKAM and stored on the PV. The curation includes the following operations:

1. Downloads the pre-built HookOS image from the Release Service 
2. Prepares the HookOS configuration file, that contains a set of orchestrator-specific configuration parameters (e.g., proxy settings, URLs, extra hosts), 
3. Generates secure keys and signs all the components of the image (vmlinuz, initramfs)
4. Compresses the HookOS image into the .tar.gz archive 
5. Reads orchestrator CA certificates and injects into the Micro-OS image during build
6. Injects environment variables into the Micro-OS image during build
7. Re-signs the Micro-OS image after CA certificates and environment variables were injected

The solution proposed in this document assumes that the Micro-OS image is stored **outside** of the orchestrator. It means that
DKAM should not do any of the steps above. Therefore, the main challenge to solve is how to provide environment variables to the Micro-OS image downloaded from an external source,
without sacrificing the security.

### Solution

The solution assumes the following:

- iPXE script along with some configuration files (e.g., CA certificates) are still stored on the orchestrator PV. Since these are small files, the provisioning time would not be impacted.
- The MicroOS image is stored in an external storage (e.g., S3 bucket) and the orchestrator provides a URL to the image. The Micro-OS image can be stored on any other external or local server.
- HookOS is replaced with a minimal Edge Microvisor Toolkit flavor that is used as a Micro-OS for provisioning.

### How the security is ensured

- The TLS certificate is embedded into the iPXE binary and it is used by Edge Node to verify downloaded MicroOS image (?)
